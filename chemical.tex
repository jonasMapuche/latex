\begin{abstract}
    \LaTeX{} manuscripts submitted to OSA journals may use these instructions and this universal template format. The template simplifies manuscript preparation and eases transfer between OSA journals. Applied Optics, JOSA A, JOSA B, Optics Letters, and Optica authors may also use the previous, legacy templates, particularly if a precise length estimate is needed. Authors will still need to adhere to article-length restrictions based on the final, published format.
\end{abstract}

\section {Introduction}
Adherence to the specifications listed in this template is essential for efficient review and publication of submissions. Proper reference format is especially important (see Section \ref{sec:refs}).

\section{Multiple corresponding authors}
There are two options for indicating multiple corresponding authorship, and they are formatted quite differently. The first format would be as follows and uses an asterisk to denote one of the authors:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{osafig1}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{First Chemical}
Figures and tables should be placed in the body of the manuscript. Standard \LaTeX{} environments should be used to place tables and figures:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{osafig1}
\caption{Sample caption (Fig. 2, \cite{Yelin:03}).}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Second Programing Language}
Figures and tables should be placed in the body of the manuscript. Standard \LaTeX{} environments should be used to place tables and figures:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{osafig1}
\caption{Sample caption (Fig. 2, \cite{Yelin:03}).}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Three Physical Education}
Figures and tables should be placed in the body of the manuscript. Standard \LaTeX{} environments should be used to place tables and figures:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{osafig1}
\caption{Sample caption (Fig. 2, \cite{Yelin:03}).}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Figures, tables, and supplementary materials}

\subsection{Figures and tables}
Figures and tables should be placed in the body of the manuscript. Standard \LaTeX{} environments should be used to place tables and figures:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{osafig1}
\caption{Sample caption (Fig. 2, \cite{Yelin:03}).}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \caption(a) Three traps create three rings of magnetic nanoparticles. (b) The rings interact with one another 
\end{figure}

\section{Mathematical and scientific notation}

\subsection{Displayed equations} Displayed equations should be centered.
Equation numbers should appear at the right-hand margin, in
parentheses:
\begin{equation}
J(\rho) =
 \frac{\gamma^2}{2} \; \sum_{k({\rm even}) = -\infty}^{\infty}
	\frac{(1 + k \tau)}{ \left[ (1 + k \tau)^2 + (\gamma  \rho)^2  \right]^{3/2} }.
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusion}
After proofreading the manuscript, compress your .tex manuscript file and all figures (which should be in EPS or PDF format) in a ZIP, TAR or TAR-GZIP package. All files must be referenced at the root level (e.g., file \texttt{figure-1.eps}, not \texttt{/myfigs/figure-1.eps}). If there are supplementary materials, the associated files should not be included in your manuscript archive but be uploaded separately through the Prism interface.

Add references with BibTeX or manually.
